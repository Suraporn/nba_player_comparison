## Reflection on `NBA_Player_Comparison` Visualization

### What not yet implemented

Due to the time limitation of the project, there are something we have not implemented and need to mention as,

- Some statistics with percentage(%) are not bound between 0%-100% because this is a specific indexes in Basketball, you can refer to the glossary [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html).

- Even though, we did data cleaning and data preprocessing, we still found some uncleaned data such as a duplicated row of a player played in a certain year. This needs to be investigate more and clean it. We try to improve this in the next milestone.
